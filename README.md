# Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets

This repository contains materials for the MSCA 31006 Machine Learning & Predictive Analytics Team Project at the University of Chicago.


## Problem Statement

Twitter's real-time, crowdsourced news has become an important communication channel in times of emergencies. Monitoring crisis-related tweets allows first responders, FEMA, and other disaster relief organizations to respond timelier and more effectively to disasters.​

However, Twitter is only as useful as its information's validity. Slang, sarcasm and hyperbole make identifying true emergencies a challenge. ​

​Thus, determining actual crisis-related tweets from non-crisis related tweets is a requirement in making Twitter useful in detecting actual crises.

## Data

We had an access to access to a dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand classified as disaster and not a disaster. 

You can find the data [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/data).

## Structure of the repository

- Scripts Folder: This folder contains the python codes for models and EDA.

- Presentation: This contains the final presentation


## Structure of the code
We have tried to cover a spectrum of topics in NLP

1. **Classical ML**: The Code contains Classical ML alogrithms with count vectorizer word embeddings.
2. **BiLSTM**: The Code contains Bi-Directional LSTM's with glove word embeddings.
3. **Bert**: The Code contains tranformer based models (BERT) to classify disaster/not a disaster. 
4. **TempCNN**: The Code contains temportal Convolutional Neural Network classify disaster/not a disaster.
5. **LSTM**: The Code contains EDA, Classical ML alogrithms with TFIDF vectorizer word embeddings, and LSTM to classify the tweets.
